This project is for posting poems to Weibo.

You need to rename tangsong.config.example to tangsong.config, and update the consumer_key, consumer_secret (in the first line), token, tokenSecret (in the second line). The two tokens in each line are separated by \t (tab).

Be sure to update the directories in tangsong.sh and tangsong.py. Currently it is /home/...

And update the symbolic link, weibopy, to the weibo python sdk directory.
